# Bluefin

Bluefin is an application I built with inspiration from a company I worked for, Redfin. It is an application for rental property owners and renters. I want to streamline the rental process from finding a property to rent, applying, making rent payments, requesting fixes, etc. I also want to make it a rental property management tool for rental property owners. 

This application was built with React, Redux for global state management, a Ruby on Rails API, and Mapbox API.
