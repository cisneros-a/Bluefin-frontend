# Bluefin

Bluefin is an application I built with inspiration from a company I worked for, Redfin. It is an application for rental property owners and renters. I want to streamline the rental process from finding a property to rent, applying, making rent payments, requesting fixes, etc. I also want to make it a rental property management tool for rental property owners. 

This application was built with React, Redux for global state management, a Ruby on Rails API, and Mapbox API. 

## Features
  #### Rental property owner dashboard:
    - Add a home: Upload a photo and property information to have home appear for renters on Map.
    - View your leased and unleased properties: Get a quick view of which properties are leased.
    - View lease: Select a home and view the lease information, including previous rent paymenets and fix requests.
    - View Applications: View all the lease applications on your properties and accept/deny them.
  
  #### Renter dashboard:
    - View all available homes: You can view homes and toggle between map/card views.
    - Apply for a lease: Select a property and choose to submit an application.
    - View your applications: See all your submitted applications and their statuses as pending/accepted/denied.
    - View your lease: You can view your lease information and ability to make fix request with pictures as well as pay rent.
